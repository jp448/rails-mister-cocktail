# rails-mister-cocktail
 Rails app where users can post cocktail recipes. 

**Introduction**

This app was created during the Le Wagon bootcamp. It is built with Ruby on Rails using a postgres database. The frontend uses the bootstrap framework and Sass. 

**Demo**

[Mr. Cocktail](https://mr-cocktail.proctor-webworks.com/)

**App Features**
* stylish design
* 3 model app
* interactive 
* MVC design pattern

**App Structure**
Rails Mr. Cocktail is a three model rails app. There is a cocktail model, a doses model, and an ingredient model. The doses model has a many to many relationship to both cocktails and ingredients. Users can choose to view cocktails already added to the homepage. A user can edit a cocktail (name, ingredients, etc) or delete a cocktail. A user can add a cocktail, a picture, and the correct doses of ingredients to the cocktail's page. Once a cocktail has been added it is also added on the homepage. 

**App Improvements**

If I had more time here are the improvements I would make to the app: 
* Make the design responsive
* Add a user photo upload option
* Add a search bar
* Make pages more dynamic with more use of JS plugins (for example animate on scroll)
